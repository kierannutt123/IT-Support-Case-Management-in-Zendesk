# IT Support with Zendesk

In modern IT environments, effective support relies on structured ticket management, clear prioritisation, and professional communication. Zendesk is a leading helpdesk platform used by IT teams to streamline these processes, providing a centralised system to receive, track, and resolve user requests. It enables technicians to manage incidents efficiently, collaborate internally, and keep clients informed throughout the resolution process.

### Key features include:

. Ticket management for creating, assigning, and updating requests with detailed activity tracking

. Priority levels to triage issues based on severity and business impact

. Internal notes for private technician collaboration

. Public replies for professional, client-facing communication

. Tags and categorisation to support reporting and workflow automation

The screenshots below demonstrate how these features are reflected in the interface. The “View” page provides an overview of all active tickets requiring attention, allowing technicians to quickly assess which issues are pending, in progress, or resolved.

The next screen shows a ticket preview, accessed by selecting the Edit option. From here, technicians can change a ticket’s priority level or incident type, add or remove tags, and draft a response. While replies can be made directly from this view, the full conversation history isn’t visible.

The final screen shows the full ticket view, accessed by double-clicking a ticket. This displays the entire chat history, allowing technicians to review previous interactions and respond with full context.

Together, these views illustrate how Zendesk streamlines ticket management, supports prioritisation, and enables clear communication between IT support staff and end users.

For me, an important part of using Zendesk effectively is communicating with clients in a way they understand. I would ensure that responses are clear, professional, and respectful, avoiding technical jargon and explaining issues and solutions in plain language. This approach helps build trust and keeps users informed throughout the support process.
